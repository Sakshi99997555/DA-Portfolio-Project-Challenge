# 📊 Lung Cancer Data Analysis: Insights for Early Detection & Risk Factors

## 🚀 Project Overview
Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent and deadliest diseases worldwide. This project analyzes a real-world dataset to uncover key risk factors, smoking impact, survival trends, and treatment effectiveness using **SQL** and **Power BI**. The goal is to generate actionable insights that can help improve early detection and prevention strategies.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Lung cancer is a leading cause of death globally. The aim of this analysis is to:
- Understand the relationship between **smoking, air pollution, and lung cancer**.
- Identify **high-risk patient groups**.
- Analyze **treatment effectiveness and survival rates**.
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** to improve early detection and prevention.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **SQL (SSMS)** - For querying and analyzing data.
- **Power BI** - For data visualization and interactive dashboards.
- **Excel** - For preprocessing and cleaning the dataset.

## 📊 Key Insights & Findings
### 🔹 Lung Cancer Overview

✔ **8,961 total cases**, **52.66 avg. patient age**, **2.83% smokers with lung cancer**, **75.09 avg. mortality rate**. 
 
✔ **Males have higher lung cancer cases than females**. 
 
✔ **Risk Score Distribution:** Low (177K), Medium (35.8K), High (7.5K). 
 
✔ **Air Pollution Impact:** Medium exposure leads to the highest mortality.  

✔ **Age Group Affected:** Highest cases in adults (25-64 years).
  
✔ **Top 10 Affected Countries:** Ethiopia, Japan, Turkey, Nigeria, USA, Myanmar, Italy, Egypt, Indonesia, France.

---

### 🔹 Smoking & Risk Factors
✔ **88.34K total smokers**, **20.42 avg. smoking years**, **127.67K high-risk patients**, **27.97% early detection rate**. 
 
✔ **Smokers have a higher lung cancer risk, but other factors (e.g., pollution) also contribute**.  

✔ **Long-term smoking is linked to advanced cancer stages (Stage 4 & Stage 2)**.  

✔ **Passive smoking shows no significant correlation with lung cancer cases**. 
 
✔ **Early detection greatly improves survival chances**.  

---

### 🔹 Treatment & Survival Analysis
✔ **0.22 avg. survival years**, **14bn total annual lung cancer deaths**, **1.50 prevalence rate**, **4.12% survival rate for early detection**. 
 
✔ **Survival Rate & Gender:** Males have slightly higher survival than females. 
 
✔ **Top 10 Countries with High Lung Cancer Deaths:** China, USA, Japan, India, Russia, Germany, Brazil, Myanmar, UK, France. 
 
✔ **Treatment & Mortality:** All treatment types (Surgery, Radiation, Chemo, None) have similar survival & mortality rates. 
 
✔ **Lung Cancer in Developed vs. Developing Nations:** Similar prevalence rates in both.  

✔ **Survival by Cancer Stage:** No significant difference in survival across stages.

### 🔹 Major Insights
✅ Smoking & pollution both impact lung cancer risk—**pollution plays a key role**. 
 
✅ **Early detection is critical—it significantly improves survival rates**.
  
✅ **Treatment type does not impact survival much—prevention & early diagnosis matter more**.  

✅ **Lung cancer is a global issue, affecting both developed & developing countries**.
